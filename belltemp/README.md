sophia is a bell management system designed for schools.  
It is composed of a Raspberry PI (or any other Linux machine), and a loudspeaker or regular electric bell.  
The system can be configured through a user-friendly web interface and represents a valid and accurate alternative to the expensive (and often inaccurate) timers that are often used for this purpose.  
The system rings the bell and/or plays a sound on the loudspeaker according to the customizable internal schedule.  
The software is very versatile and can plan different timetables: daily, weekly, monthly or custom.  
The internal clock is automatically synchronized with a remote atomic clock via NTP once per day.  
The system is designed for schools but is suitable for a lot more applications!  
The system supports an optional HD44780 or serial LCD to display the time from the internal clock.  


sophia has been tested on the following hardware:  
|--|
|Raspberry PI 1 model B|
|Raspberry PI 3 model B|
